# Jester

A web app created to demonstrate and explore the development of enterprise-like applications.

With previous self-taught experience, I return with an ambitious attempt to revive my Back End skills and finally put to bed blockers I encountered when I had no commercial experience of any kind.

It has been a thrilling few days so far building this, and I am hugely excited to be building and growing along with this challenge.

This is part of my journey towards full stack (.NET and Javascript-based front ends).

# Demo

I'll try to add a video here later.

<!-- [Watch this preview](./Demo/Demo%20(FE)%202024-05-26.mp4) -->

You can also build it yourself, see below for details.

# Build it yourself

This is an ASP.NET Core project, you'll need .NET SDK at a minimum, and optionally VS Code.

You can clone the repo as usual but you will need a `postgreSQL` instance running. You can update credential details on `appsettings.{environment}.json` files. I recommend using docker for installing the db, just make sure you expose to the same network as the app (usually, your host machine).

Feel free to swap out PostgresSQL for other DBs that EF Core supports.

## Updating DB through EF Core
You should be at the content root where all source code is i.e. Jester/Jester

1. Add a migration with a `MigrationName` of your own
    ```
    dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName
    ```
1. Update database with the new migration you created
    ```
    dotnet ef database update
    ```
1. To remove the last migration
    ```
    dotnet ef migrations remove
    ```

## Release checklist

- [x] Prepare dockerfile
- [x] Test locally
- [x] Setup accounts on Railway and Supabase
- [x] Initialise
- [x] Deploy code to git
- [x] Let Railway do its thing
- [x] Test Supabase connection
- [x] Generate Railway domain
- [x] App is live ðŸš€
    - [x] Fix issue with port (fixed by adding PORT var to railway)
    - [x] Fix issue with connection string (fixed by correcting env var name on railway)
    - [x] Fix issue with seeding file not being available on the prod workdir
        - ~~Struggled to resolve. I tried to recreate locally with environment set to prod. nada. I tried it in docker. nada. I tried on another platform. It had issues with ssl, but never complained about file not being found. Burnt enough time on it - will be moving to building more features before I return to it (with possibly professional help)~~ Had to cleanup and correct Dockerfile
    - [x] Deploy to host with dev-cert ðŸš€
